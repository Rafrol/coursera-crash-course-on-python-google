Conditionals Cheat Sheet
In earlier videos, we took a look at some of the built-in Python operators that allow us to compare values, and some logical operators we can use to combine values. 
We also learned how to use operators in if-else-elif blocks. 

Itâ€™s a lot to learn but, with practice, it gets easier to remember it all. In the meantime, this handy cheat sheet gives you all the information you need at a glance. 

Comparison operators
a == b: a is equal to b

a != b: a is different than b

a < b: a is smaller than b

a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b

a > b: a is bigger than b

a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b

Logical operators
a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.

a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.

not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.

Branching blocks

In Python, we branch our code using if, else and elif. This is the branching syntax:

if condition1:
	if-block
elif condition2:
	elif-block
else:
	else-block

Remember: The if-block will be executed if condition1 is True. The elif-block will be executed if condition1 is False and condition2 is True. 
The else block will be executed when all the specified conditions are false.
