## Classes and Methods Cheat Sheet
In the past few videos, we’ve seen how to define classes and methods in Python. Here, you’ll find a run-down of everything we’ve covered, so you can refer to it whenever you need a refresher.

### **Defining classes and methods**

```
class ClassName:
    def method_name(self, other_parameters):
        body_of_method
```

### **Classes and Instances**
* Classes define the behavior of all instances of a specific class.

* Each variable of a specific class is an instance or object.

* Objects can have attributes, which store information about the object.

* You can make objects do work by calling their methods.

* The first parameter of the methods (self) represents the current instance.

* Methods are just like functions, but they can only be used through a class.

### **Special methods**

* Special methods start and end with &#95;&#95;.
* Special methods have specific names, like &#95;&#95;init&#95;&#95; for the constructor or &#95;&#95;str&#95;&#95; for the conversion to string.

### **Documenting classes, methods and functions**

* You can add documentation to classes, methods, and functions by using docstrings right after the definition. Like this:

```
class ClassName:
    """Documentation for the class."""
    def method_name(self, other_parameters):
        """Documentation for the method."""
        body_of_method
        
def function_name(parameters):
    """Documentation for the function."""
    body_of_function
```
